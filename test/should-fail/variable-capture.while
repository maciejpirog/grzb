; If substitution is capture-free, the following program would produce the obligation
; 
; (forall (m78) (>= (+ 10 m) m78))
;
; which cannot be discharged (counterexample: m -> 0) and grzb fails
;
; On the other hand, if substitution is not capture-free, the obligation becomes
;
; (forall (m) (>= (+ 10 m) m)
;
; and grzb suceeds. So, this test definitely should fail.
